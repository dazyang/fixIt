# re-imaging wcc fixIt

The intention of this project is to redesign Wellington City Council's app â€“ FixIt.

As an user and a citizen of Wellington, I find the feature of the app too light and lack of interactions between Council and citizens. A few features are proposed in this revision to improve usability and to engage users.
